## Summary
This game is about... this should be at least 3-4 paragraphs summarising the gameplay mechanics of the game. You should be answering the who, what, when, where, why, and how of the game itself.

Project Rhombus is a rhythm-based that combines simplly stylish design with electric music. The gameplay is as simple as facing the center arrow the way the note is coming from. The notes come from above, below, right and left and they all vary in speed to trick you on which order they'll hit you.

The game also has two types of notes which are distinguished by their color, yellow and blue. The yellow notes behave like you'd expect with them just heading towards you. The blue notes on the other hand head towards you but, about half way through they go to the oppposite side at the halfway point.

The blue notes are what makes the game really hard since sometimes you have to keep track of 6-8 notes at once and sometimes you don't notice one of the notes is blue which causes you to lose. The multiple speeds and the four different directions the notes are moving from make the game hard 

## Final Thoughts
I like this about the game but didn't like this particular feature. This should be at a minimum of one paragraph.
