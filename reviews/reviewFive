## Summary
This game is about... this should be at least 3-4 paragraphs summarising the gameplay mechanics of the game. You should be answering the who, what, when, where, why, and how of the game itself.

LIMBO is a black and white 2 side scroller with very dark elements. In LIMBO you play as a boy who enters limbo in search of his
sister. The controls are simple, arrow keys to move and control to grab things. The first area just requires you to move forward
and move a cart to jump on to proceed, easy start. After that you simply progress forward and use a boat to get across a lake and
avoid some bear traps.

After you get past the bear traps and other things you run into a wall, occupied by a huge spider. When you get to close to the 
spider it tries to strike you with his huge legs and stabs into the ground if it misses. After you dodge the spider a couple of
times a bear trap will drop from the tree. When you get this trap you can drag it and bait the spider into slamming into the 
trap and cutting it's legs off until it runs away.

Later, you progress 

## Final Thoughts
