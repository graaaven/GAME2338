## Summary

LIMBO is a black and white 2 side scroller with very dark elements. In LIMBO you play as a boy who enters limbo in search of his sister. The controls are simple, arrow keys to move and control to grab things. The first area just requires you to move forward
and move a cart to jump on to proceed, easy start. After that you simply progress forward and use a boat to get across a lake and
avoid some bear traps.

After you get past the bear traps and other things you run into a wall, occupied by a huge spider. When you get to close to the 
spider it tries to strike you with his huge legs and stabs into the ground if it misses. After you dodge the spider a couple of
times a bear trap will drop from the tree. When you get this trap you can drag it and bait the spider into slamming into the 
trap and cutting it's legs off until it runs away.

Later, you progress a wide cave area which turns out to be where the 5 legged spider lived and catchs you into a caccoon 
but, leaves you and now your movement is restricted from running and jumping to small jumps and big jumps forward. With your
restricted movement you have to progress further by making some pretty hard jumps. When you make it past all of those jumps 
you have to stand on a boulder and keep it moving without falling over while being chased by the spider.

## Final Thoughts
I like this about the game but didn't like this particular feature. This should be at a minimum of one paragraph.

I loved this game for many things like the heavy atmosphere and the art of the game really appealed to me. I was fully 
immersed and had fun solving the puzzles. The game difficulty was good, some parts were pretty hard and required me to
do mutliple tries but, the other parts weren't too hard and allowed me to progress smoothly. Lastly, I'm going back to
LIMBO to finish it right now.
