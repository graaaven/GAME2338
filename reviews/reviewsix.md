## Summary
This game is about... this should be at least 3-4 paragraphs summarising the gameplay mechanics of the game. You should be answering the who, what, when, where, why, and how of the game itself.

Ori and the Blind Forest is about an orphan name Ori who is destined for heroics. Ori and the Blind Forest is a 2D platformer where you adventure through a huge forest and unlock powers to progress. It first starts with basic movement which feels really fast but smooth. There is also standard jumping where you tap for a small jump and hold for a big jump. Later a skill to deal with enemies and the ability to wall climb up huge walls.

Ori and the Blind Forest has spike traps that have to be avoided and they have traps that you can destroy. To progress through many sections you have to find a certain amount of keys to open a gate. As I mentioned earlier there are enemies, and quite a variety of them. There are enemies that jump and slam on you, there are ones that just do short hops but on death they split into multiple mini enemies.

Ori and the Blind Forest even has a skill tree 

## Final Thoughts
I like this about the game but didn't like this particular feature. This should be at a minimum of one paragraph.
