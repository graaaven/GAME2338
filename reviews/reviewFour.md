### Rating
I rate out of 10, Drop Alive was a 9/10 for me.

## Summary
Drop Alive is a cutesy 2D platformer about a water drop in a cup trying to make it's way to a river. The controls are very simple
to the point to where th game doesn't even tell you them because its just A and D to move and space to jump. The first level is a
simple level where you move along a kitchen counter. The level isn't challenging but it makes you learn all of the base mechanics 
before you move on. Because you can't get the the end of the level without jumping and climbing so that when you went to the second
level you'll be able to clmb which will help alot. 

The second level you're moving through an oven to and using the heat to rise to the top. The level is much harder than the first
and introduces a new mechanic, turning into steam. You can turn into steam by touching a hot pipe nearby and when you're steam you
rise and need to avoid flames that would put your water out. When you're controlling steam you can to the sides or move down 
alittle, but moving down makes you smaller and puts you closer to death. Though every so often there is a leak of water that can
turn you back to a drop and replenish your water. 

The Third level you enter is a refridgerator and using the cold to help you progress through the level. This level introduces a new
mechanic, turning into an ice ball and rolling through the level. when you turn into an ice ball by moving into a fridge fan so you
can roll really fast. Turning into an ice ball allows you to break the ice walls inside the fridge that block you and allow you to
jump huge gaps and skip alot of platforming. The rest of the levels introduce new mechanics and start combining many of the 
mechanics together to get through the level. 

## Final Thoughts
I loved Drop Alive's art style, it looked so good and I sometimes stopped just to look around, especially on the first level.
The music was also pretty nice, so even though the game only took about 2 hours to complete I remember everything really well. 
I found the difficulty escalation was really good, it only got really hard at the end. Drop Alive was a great game and i'm glad I
played it, and it was free too.
