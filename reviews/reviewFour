## Summary
This game is about... this should be at least 3-4 paragraphs summarising the gameplay mechanics of the game. You should be answering the who, what, when, where, why, and how of the game itself.

Drop Alive is a cutesy 2d platformer about a water drop in a cup trying to make it's way to a river. The controls are very simple to the point to where th game doesn't even tell you them because its
just A and D to move and space to jump. The first level is a simple level where you move along a kitchen counter. The level isn't challenging but it makes you learn all of the base mechanics 
before you move on. Because you can't get the the end of the level without jumping and climbing so that when you went to the second level you'll be able to clmb which will help alot. 

The second level you're moving through an oven to and using the heat to rise to the top. The level is much harder than the first and introduces a new mechanic, turning into steam. You can turn 
into steam by touching a hot pipe nearby and when you're steam you rise and need to avoid flames that would put your water out. When you're controlling steam you can to the sides or move down 
alittle, but moving down makes you smaller and puts you closer to death. Though every so often there is a leak of water that can turn you back to a drop and replenish your water. 

The Third level you enter a refridgerator
## Final Thoughts
I like this about the game but didn't like this particular feature. This should be at a minimum of one paragraph.
