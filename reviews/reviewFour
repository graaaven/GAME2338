## Summary
This game is about... this should be at least 3-4 paragraphs summarising the gameplay mechanics of the game. You should be answering the who, what, when, where, why, and how of the game itself.

Drop Alive is a 2d platformer about a water drop in a cup trying to make it's way to a river. The controls are very simple to the point to where th game doesn't even tell you them because its
just A and D to move and space to jump.

## Final Thoughts
I like this about the game but didn't like this particular feature. This should be at a minimum of one paragraph.
