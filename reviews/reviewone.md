## Summary
This game is about... this should be at least 3-4 paragraphs summarising the gameplay mechanics of the game. You should be answering the who, what, when, where, why, and how of the game itself.

 
 This game is about fighting ships with your ship in space and progressing through levels. In Survive in Space you have four abilities on your ship that vary based on your ship choice. The first level of the game is simple there are just two enemy types, one that flies right at you and one that shoots at you alittle and flies at you which makes an easy starting point.but, every stage higher you go you face a new enemy and every 10 stages you fight a boss.The scaling bosses are challenging but fun to fight. The bosses all have hard gimmicks to overcome like dodging shots that shoot out and spread while also dodging a wall of shots.
  The game has two ways of scaling higher, one is from killing enemies you get to increase your player level, and the other one is every time. Since you can get stronger without progressing through the levels means if you're stuck you can farm to clear the stage you're stuck on. As you progress through the stages you can upgrade your ship's skills. The controls for Survive In Space were really weird to get used to.               

## Final Thoughts
I like this about the game but didn't like this particular feature. This should be at a minimum of one paragraph.
