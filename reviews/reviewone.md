## Summary
This game is about... this should be at least 3-4 paragraphs summarising the gameplay mechanics of the game. You should be answering the who, what, when, where, why, and how of the game itself.
 
 This game is about fighting ships with your ship in space and progressing through levels. In Survive in Space you have four abilities on your ship that vary based on your ship choice. The first level of the game is simple there are just two enemy types, one that flies right at you and one that shoots at you alittle and flies at you which makes an easy starting point. But, every stage higher you go you face a new enemy and every 10 stages you fight a boss.The scaling bosses are challenging but fun to fight due to the hard gimmicks you have to overcome like dodging shots that shoot out and spread while also dodging a wall of shots.
  
  The game has two ways of scaling higher, one is from killing enemies you get to increase your player level, and the other one is every time. Since you can get stronger without progressing through the levels means if you're stuck you can farm to clear the stage you're stuck on. As you progress through the stages you can upgrade your ship's skills. the ship upgrades are all about upgrading the four abilities. You can upgrade the abilities by giving them things like raw damage, life steal, stun chance, and instant kill chance.
   
  The controls for Survive In Space were really weird to get used to, first off you move with arrow keys in a 2d space which is fine but for abilities it uses QWER which means you can't use your mouse to aim. So, to move around in the 2d space and hit enemies behind you, you have to hit the space keep to flip the direction you are aiming. It was so bizzare and hard to get used to it took me about 30 min to comfortably play and avoid things without missing enemies because im facing the wrong direction.     

## Final Thoughts
I like this about the game but didn't like this particular feature. This should be at a minimum of one paragraph.
