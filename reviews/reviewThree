## Summary
This game is about... this should be at least 3-4 paragraphs summarising the gameplay mechanics of the game. You should be answering the who, what, when, where, why, and how of the game itself.

The Talos Principle is a first/third person game about a robot solving puzzles inside a simulation. The movement is standard wasd 
moving and jumping. To solve the puzzles you're given tools like a jammer that disables turrets, doors, and enemies. The turrets 
shoot you if they walk into their line of sight so you have to disable them before moving ahead. For doors they are energy doors 
so jamming the door actually opens it to allow you to go past. The enemies roam a set area and kill you if you get too close, they
can be jammed to get past.

## Final Thoughts
I like this about the game but didn't like this particular feature. This should be at a minimum of one paragraph.
