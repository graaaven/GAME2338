I rate out of 10. The Talos Principle is a 9/10

## Summary
The Talos Principle is a first/third person game about a robot solving puzzles inside a simulation. The movement is standard wasd 
moving and jumping. To solve the puzzles you're given tools like a jammer that disables turrets, doors, and enemies but, you only
get a certain amound based on the level. The turrets shoot you if they walk into their line of sight so you have to disable them
before moving ahead. For doors they are energy doors so jamming the door actually opens it to allow you to go past. The enemies
roam a set area and kill you if you get too close, they can be jammed to get past.

Later into the game you get more tools like one that redirects a laser. These are used to redirect lasers to specific points to 
open doors to progress. There are times where you have to juggle multiple lasers going to different spots and not having them 
overlap because that would stop both of them from working. To get around the lasers getting in the way you have to use elevated 
ground to have one go over the other.

Nearing the end of the game you get this "replay" mechanic where you do use some actions and they get replayed in time with when
you used it. Where this is important is you can use the tools in the replay mode and in the live mode so if you only have one jammer
you can use two with the repaly mode. Where this mechanic gets complicated when you have to start doing two minute replays and matching
with it.Turns into alot of retrying and tedious actions you done 5 times already.


## Final Thoughts
I loved this game, the mechanics were really fun except for one, replay mode. But, the rest of the mechanics were good and enjoyable. 
The game allows you to move quite fast. so, once you get the hang of the puzzles you can run them really fast which was nice since
when you messed up you can recover fast. Lastly, The game looks good, it feels pretty good, and it has alot of puzzles to do and 
you don't have to do all of them.
