Question: During your playtesting where the rules of the game understandable? If not, what was not clear.

Answer: The rules were clear, though I missed some of them because the tutorial got boring I missed the fact that you can move where the ball is shot from and change the angle it's shot at.

Question: During gameplay did you notice anything that shouldn't be in the game or could be removed and it wouldn't effect game play?

Answer: 3D view, the 3D is so confusing to see things and just makes things harder so U always use 2D mode where you get a downview angle on the level.
