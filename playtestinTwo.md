Question: During your playtesting where the rules of the game understandable? If not, what was not clear.

Answer: The rules were clear, though I missed some of them because the tutorial got boring I missed the fact that you can move where the ball is shot from and change the angle it's shot at.

Question: During gameplay did you notice anything that shouldn't be in the game or could be removed and it wouldn't effect game play?

Answer: 3D view, the 3D is so confusing to see things and just makes things harder so U always use 2D mode where you get a downview angle on the level. 

Question: Is this game balanced? If not, what is the target audience for this game based on that imbalance?

Answer: I think the game is fairly balanced for the hard and the easy difficulties.

Question: Does the timing of this game appear to be about right for this type of game?

Answer: The timing for this game seems a bit weird since not that many puzzle games these days

Question: During gameplay did the mechanics and theme go together and reinforce each other?

Answer: no, both felt different and isolated from eachother.

Question: Did you have fun playing this game?

Answer: yes, but mostly in short bursts as lot of the setup to completing levels was boring but taking a shot in the dark and hoping the level would be completed after like 30 bounces was pretty great when it worked.

Question: During gameplay what problems or issues seemed to happen and how did you get them to reoccur?

Answer: There was a bug when I tried to place something down off of the map and it let me do it and I couldn't get it back.
