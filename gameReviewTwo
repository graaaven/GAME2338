## Summary
This game is about... this should be at least 3-4 paragraphs summarising the gameplay mechanics of the game. 
You should be answering the who, what, when, where, why, and how of the game itself.

The Howler is a puzzle physics-based game about flying through the skies in a hot air balloon. 
to move you press w to go up and depending on your height would change the direction the hot air balloon would go. 
The early puzzles mostly involve just lifting the hot air balloon over small buildings and reaching the endpoint. 

The later puzzles add in addition obstacles like tall buildings that have opposite winds above them so you can't just float above
and you have to use momentum to get past the opposite winds. They also add little "enemies" that can pop your hot air balloon which
in up and down or left to right patterns. When you make a mistake it takes so long to go back and attempt it again, but you can restart
the level. Though, when you start getting long missions it becomes faster to slowly fly back and reattempt the part of the level. 
This makes the game punishing in a bad way and made me get bored after spending more time backtracking to the previous part to attempt
it and caused me to get bored of playing it after the first 30 min.

There was also technical problems like the game not having a proper full screeen mode which made it harder to play. 

## Final Thoughts
I like this about the game but didn't like this particular feature. This should be at a minimum of one paragraph.
