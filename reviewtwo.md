## Summary

The Howler is a puzzle physics-based game about flying through the skies in a hot air balloon. 
to move you press w to go up and depending on your height would change the direction the hot air balloon would go. 
The early puzzles mostly involve just lifting the hot air balloon over small buildings and reaching the endpoint. 

The later puzzles add in addition obstacles like tall buildings that have opposite winds above them so you can't just float above and you have to use momentum to get past the opposite winds. They also add little "enemies" that can pop your hot air balloon which in up and down or left to right patterns. When you make a mistake it takes so long to go back and attempt it again, but you can restart the level. Though, when you start getting long missions it becomes faster to slowly fly back and reattempt the part of the level. This makes the game punishing in a bad way and made me get bored after spending more time backtracking to the previous part to attemptit and caused me to get bored of playing it after the first 30 min.

The Howler also has this mechanic of making noise into your mic to lift the air balloon. Which is mainly for blowing into the mic to rise or making a loud noise to drop a package Which was kind of fun. To move the hot air balloon forward without going up too much you blow in tiny short bursts. To rise you make a smooth stream of blowing.

## Final Thoughts

The Howler is a challenging game with simple mechanics but, if you mess up it's way too punishing and takes forever to make it back to where you were before to attempt it again. The game could go along way by adding checkpoints and make going backwards faster by making the winds in the high area faster. The game was cropped to a smaller screen and didn't have any options to change that. Lastly, the game looks really good with a old school paint look and the gameplay was pretty good, but simple and slow.
